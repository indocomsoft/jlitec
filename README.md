# JLite Compiler

## Requirements
- Java 14
- Bash shell
- Connection to the internet

This project uses the gradle build system, which can self-bootstrap via
`gradle/wrapper/graddle-wrapper.jar`.
As such, all the `Makefile` does is invoke gradle to build the jar artifact.
If gradle has not been set up before, the self-bootstrapping process will
download all the requirements, freeing you from having to install anything
besides Java 14.

## How to compile
In your shell, run:
```
$ make
```

## How to run
In your shell, run:
```
$ ./jlitec
```

To get the options available, run:
```
$ ./jlitec --help
```

To pretty print a JLite file, you can use the `pretty_print` subcommand.
For example:
```
$ ./jlitec pretty_print test/pass/e.j
class Main {
  Void main(Int i, Int a, Int b, Int d) {
    while (true) {
      b = 340;
      t1 = t2;
    }
  }
}
class Dummy {
  Dummy j;
  Int dummy() {
    Bool i;
    Bool j;
    return i;
  }
}

```

There are 2 other subcommands available that you may find useful:
- `lex` to print out the CUP symbols generated by the lexer.
- `ast` to print out the AST in JSON format.

## Java 14 Preview Features
This project uses Java 14 features, so you will need to pass `--enable-preview`
if you are running the jar file yourself.

This should be handled by the `./jlitec` wrapper script.
